## Notes

### Branches

* The only **permanent branches** are the `master` and `develop` branches. The `master` branch is the production branch.
* **Feature branches** are usually *local* branches.
* **Hotfix branches** are also local branches, but in practice they may be pushed to remote first for continuous integration, when they can be tagged as 'release candidate'.
* **Release branches** are remote *integration* branches (that is, they are actually *release candidates*), but they are *deleted after they are merged to `master`*.

### Development

* Feature branches can be created *anytime* on the `develop` branch. There is no mandated 'synchronisation point' where everyone merge back and then branch out again.
* Development actually also be done directly on the `develop` branch. Nevertheless, you are still encouraged to *branch locally* anyway as a matter of good practice, except for the most trivial tasks.
* Since feature branches are local, you can cleanup your local commits before pushing to remote, by squashing or rebasing. But don't change anything you have already pushed.
* In reality, the picture is not so pretty - the diagram does not depict developers pulling new commits from `develop` branch into their feature branches to keep up. The resulting merges tend to make the git history hard to read. More experienced developers may want to do a `pull --rebase` instead.
* *Feature branches are not meant to be long-lived*. It is extremely difficult to keep a long-lived feature branch clean in the midst of fast and furious development. Features should therefore be *small enough that they can be developed by a single person*.
* Anything that is already merged to `develop` branch cannot be 'unmerged'. Risky feature development may be manageable using techniques such as '[Feature Toggles](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)'.

### Releases

* After a release branch is created, *all fixes related to the release must be done on the release branch*. These fixes will end up in the `develop` branch after the release is concluded and merged to `master`.

### Hotfixes

* Hotfixes branch out from `master`, and are subsequently are merged back to `master` and `develop`. Hotfixes skip the release branch process.
* Note that there is actually a special case - when hotfixes occur *while a release is on-going*, and the hotfix is relevant to the release, they need to be *merged into the `release` branch* as well.
